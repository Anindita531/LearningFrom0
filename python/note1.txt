objective is:
“How did the number of COVID-19 cases change over time in India?”

What this means:
We will look at COVID-19 case data from India.

We will analyze how the number of cases grew or reduced day by day or month by month.

We will visualize this trend using graphs so it’s easy to understand.

Next step (Step 2): Get the data.
For this objective, we need a dataset that contains COVID-19 daily or weekly cases for India.
Which one would you like to start with? Here’s a quick reminder:

Predict future cases with forecasting models (easy and very useful).

State-wise analysis for deeper insights per region.

Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.

Analyze government interventions by adding lockdown dates or policies.

Prepare a polished report or GitHub repo with your findings and code.
