Great question! Here’s a simple overview of what usually gets done in a **COVID Dashboard** project:

---

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

* Gather COVID-19 data (cases, deaths, recoveries) from trusted sources (e.g., Johns Hopkins, WHO).
* Clean data: handle missing values, fix date formats, unify location names.

### 2. **Data Transformation**

* Convert wide format data to long format (date-wise).
* Calculate new metrics like daily new cases, active cases, mortality rates.
* Aggregate data by country, state, or globally as needed.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Plot trends of total and daily cases over time.
* Compare different countries/regions.
* Identify peaks, waves, or patterns like seasonality.

### 4. **Forecasting**

* Use time series models (like Prophet) to predict future cases.
* Show confidence intervals to express uncertainty.

### 5. **Visualization & Dashboarding**

* Create interactive charts: line plots, bar charts, maps.
* Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, Plotly Dash, or Streamlit.
* Allow filtering by date range, country, or state.

### 6. **Insights & Reporting**

* Highlight important trends (e.g., rising cases in a region).
* Show the impact of interventions (lockdowns, vaccination).
* Help policy makers and public stay informed.
