📚 HTML Learning Step Projects

A set of step‑by‑step HTML practice projects created to help beginners learn HTML fundamentals by building real pages and layouts. These projects are part of a broader full‑stack learning path, starting with foundational front‑end skills and progressing toward advanced web development.

🧠 Project Purpose

This folder contains hands‑on HTML step projects designed to:

Teach semantic HTML structure

Build confidence with common tags and elements

Create practical layouts using real HTML code

Reinforce learning by building useful pages from scratch

These projects help you transition from learning syntax to actually building pages, a core skill in front‑end development.

📂 What You’ll Learn

Through these projects, you will practice:

✔️ Basic HTML page structure (doctype, html, head, body)
✔ Writing and organizing text content
✔ Using images, links, and lists
✔ Creating tables and forms
✔ Semantic elements like header, main, footer, nav, section
✔ Embedding media (audio/video)
✔ Structuring content with divs, spans, and layout elements
✔ Handling interactive elements (like buttons)

These skills form the core of building static web pages.

🚀 How to Run These Projects Locally

Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/Anindita531/LearningFrom0.git


Navigate to the HTML projects folder

cd LearningFrom0/FULLSTACK/rt/HTML\ Learning\ Step\ Projects


Open any HTML file

Simply double‑click an .html file to open it in your browser

Or serve the files with a simple HTTP server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for development

📌 Suggested Workflow

💡 Start from the simplest project (like basic structure or text layout) →
Progress to more structured pages that include forms, tables, media →
Finally, explore layouts with combined elements.

This gradual approach reinforces concepts as your complexity increases.

🧩 What’s Next

Once you’re comfortable with these HTML steps:

Add CSS for styling and layout

Learn JavaScript for interactivity

Combine with backend fundamentals for full‑stack projects

HTML mastery forms the base of all future web development learning.
